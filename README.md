## Overview:

This plugin provides a minimal, lightweight solution to turn a collection of HTML elements into a selectable list.

Features:

- Turn any collection of elements into a selectable list
- Supports single and multiple selections
- Flexible markup! Molds to your HTML and CSS.
- Customizable class names
- Customizable getter
- Callbacks for click, double click, change
- API to get, set, select all, select none, and disable selection
- Compact! (About 230 lines)

## Installing

Include the minified version of this plugin in your project or install via NPM:

```
npm install --save @claviska/jquery-selectable
```

## Attaching the plugin

Minimal example that attaches the plugin to a group of list items:

```html
<ul class="my-list">
  <li data-value="some-val-1">Item 1</li>
  <li data-value="some-val-2">Item 2</li>
  <li data-value="some-val-3">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
$('.my-list').selectable();
```

This will let you select any `<li>` inside of `.my-list` by clicking on it. When an item is selected, it will receive the `active` class by default. For flexibility, the plugin doesn't add styles to selected elements — this is left to your stylesheet.

Example with all possible options:

```javascript
$('.my-list').selectable({
  // Options (default shown)
  getValue: function() {
    return $(this).attr('data-value');
  },
  items: 'li',
  multiple: false,
  disabledClass: 'disabled',
  selectedClass: 'selected',

  // Callbacks
  change: function(values, elements) { ... },
  click: function(value, element, event) { ... }
});
```

### Options

- `getValue`: a getter function that returns the value of an element in your collection. By default, the plugin will use the `data-value` attribute.

- `items`: a selector used to group items into the collection. Defaults to `li`. Try `a` to make a group of links selectable or `.my-class` to make all items with a specific class selectable. (The selector will only match children of the container that you instantiated the plugin on.)

- `multiple`: whether or not multiple selections are allowed. Defaults to `false`.

- `disabledClass`: a class to apply to each item when the control is disabled. Defaults to `disabled`.

- `selectedClass`: a class to apply to each selected item. Defaults to `selected`.

### Callbacks

All callbacks are called in the context of the respective container you instantiated the plugin on.

For the `change` callback, two arguments are available. The first is an array of selected values and the second is an array containing the selected elements.

For the `click` callback, three arguments are available. The first is the value of the target item, the second is the target element, and the third is the event.

- `change`: runs when the selection changes, including when changes are made programmatically.
- `click`: runs when an item is clicked. Returning false will prevent the selection from being toggled.

**Using Anchors?** If your selectable targets are `<a>` elements, the plugin will automatically prevent clicks from hijacking the page — there's no need to use your own `event.preventDefault()` on them.

### Methods

Methods are called using this syntax:

```javascript
$('.my-list').selectable('method', arg);
```

The following API methods are supported:

- `change`: Triggers the change event (will only run if a change has actually been made). Useful when you need to trigger a change after working with items directly in the DOM.

- `create` (default): initializes the plugin on the given container.

- `destroy`: returns the control to its pre-initialized state.

- `getElements`: returns a jQuery object containing all elements in the collection. Passing `true` as an argument will return only selected elements. Passing a string or an array will return all elements that have those values.

- `selectAll`: selects all items in the collection.

- `selectNone`: clears selection from all items in the collection.

- `value`: when no argument is passed, this method returns an array of values of the current selection. When a string or array is passed as an argument, this method will set the selection to any item matching the specified values.

## Changelog

- 2.0.0
  - Fixed a bug where using the `click` callback would prevent selection from being toggled.
  - Removed the `doubleClick` callback. Users who need this are encouraged to attach their own listener and use the methods above to obtain the selected values and elements.
